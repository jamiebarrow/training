# Architecture

This is a course that goes into topics related to software or system architecture.

I do not try and focus on specific certifications, standards, etc. as yet but there are some that may be relevant.

Topics that I feel are important related to software architecture, include but are not limited to:

- Security
- Reliability
- Resilience
- Performance
- Scalability
- Data Management
- Configuration Management
- Observability
- Failure Recovery
- Cost Optimization
- Capacity
- Automation
- Versioning
- Dependency Management
- Communication
