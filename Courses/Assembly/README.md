# Assembly

This area will contain references that can be useful in explaining how a computer works, and will have a brief
introduction into how Assembly works, or at least will try to explain the instruction lifecycle that is the basis of
all the current modern day computing. The fetch-execute-decode lifecycle for example helps one understand how a simple
CPU works, Assembly language, compilation, etc.

A simple simulator can be used to illustrate these concepts, such as [MARIE.js][1].
