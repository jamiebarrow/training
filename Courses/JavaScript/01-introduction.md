# Introduction to JavaScript

Before showing how JavaScript _works_, it is valuable to first explain what JavaScript _is_ and the history
behind the language. This is both interesting, but at times also explains why things are the way they are, and perhaps
can guide the reader when looking forward into what will be coming to the JavaScript ecosystem in the future.

## What is JavaScript?

Many people may hear "JavaScript" and immediately think it relates to the [Javaâ„¢][1] programming language, and while
they do have shared histories, they are in fact completely different things.

I highly recommend watching the NDC London Conference talk by Richard Campbell titled
["How We Got Here - The History of Web Development"][2], or his talk ["The History of .NET"][3] which was a trip down
memory lane of all the various technologies that popped up over time in the web development and .NET space.
