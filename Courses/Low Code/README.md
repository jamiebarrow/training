# Low Code

Low Code platforms offer developers with a rapid application development (RAD) lifecycle.

Pre-built components are used and then perhaps customized, or connected together, to achieve functionality that more
experienced developers may be able to build from scratch.

Having pre-built components allows for consumers of these low code platforms to focus more on building the application,
as they do not need to focus on building the specific components.

Typically, the tools also simplify programming experiences, such as flow control, filtering, and other patterns one
may seen in a UML activity diagram (as an example).

Tools such as Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF), should be familiar to developers that may have used Team Foundation
Services (TFS) to define continuous integration (CI) build processes in the past, where these may have been defined in
a complex XML based file, but presented to developers/users as an easier to comprehend workflow diagram.

When I started to learn how to program, I started out using Visual Basic 4.0 which provided an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) experience where I could build Windows applications by just dragging and dropping controls onto a
window, moving them around with the mouse to align and resize them, double clicking the controls to add behavior, etc.

Much of the code that would typically have been created to actually create the Windows form, create the control, set
the properties and event handlers, is then all generated code from the tooling present in the IDE. This in itself is
a low code tool.

Some services also provide different connectors, which then bring the promises of Service Oriented Architecture to life
by having a list of available service endpoints that can then be integrated with other service endpoints in a way that
feels like connecting two pieces of a puzzle, or snapping LEGO blocks together to achieve some desired outcome.

These days there are also platforms for doing long running business processes using this mindset, perhaps executing
applications as a step in a workflow, or calling a web endpoint or webhook when a certain condition or event arises.
These allow for more connected experiences, integration points, and automation scenarios with much less development
expertise and effort. Visualizations as well of what part of a process has completed, which part is currently executing,
being able to re-execute tasks, inspect output of certain tasks, pause, resume or cancel workflows etc.
