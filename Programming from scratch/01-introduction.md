# Introduction

I often think of how I started to use computers, which was to play games on an old DOS computer. I would have to
ask Dad to help me load up `DIGGER.EXE`, until he eventually taught me the command line well enough so I could do
it myself. When we got a computer with Windows 3.1 on it, he taught me how to open Windows, and launch Solitaire
from the Program Manager. Over time I would play around enough that I could teach myself how to do it, and open other
games or applications.

I used to just launch each program and try figure out what it does, and how to use it.
I would try every keyboard shortcut imaginable, until I was very productive, because the applications started to use
common pattterns. It wasn't always like that, I remember using WordPerfect in the command line, and often the shortcut
keys were very different to what they are today. Back then CTRL+S wasn't the ubiquitious shortcut for "Save" like it is
today, I think it may have even been something like F7. CTRL+Q was often a command to quit an application as well, or
perhaps CTRL+C wouldn't copy, but would stop your application immediately, depending on the application.

In primary school I wanted to learn how to use batch scripts, and would want to learn to make my own games, so taught
myself QBASIC from the help file or from the manuals and old CODE magazines that my Dad had kept on the bookshelf.
We had a Commodore64 when I was younger, but I only ever used it for playing games like Rambo, Decathlon or Burger Time
(or Mr. Wimpy, I forget the game name).

It would only be in high school that I would really make games, after learning Visual Basic 4.0 from the TechNet and
MSDN CD's that had been collecting dust in my Dad's office. I was priviledged enough to be able to take the Computer
Science class in high school, as not all students were allowed to due to there being only limited class times for it.

Though, I had already taught myself some of the theory while I was reading MSDN articles on the CD's, or reading
VB tutorials on forums on the internet on the weekends. I didn't need to follow the class about bubble sort
because I had already implemented that algorithm previously in my own personal time by trying out the code from
these tutorials, I just didn't know it had a name of "Bubble Sort", or that there were other algorithms that were
smarter and more efficient.

I liked that, learning better ways of doing things. I spent some of the lessons doing better things myself, like
figuring out how to call the Win32 API's directly from Visual Basic to make my animations in my screensavers and games
render quicker. Or just to try them out, for fun, to see what they did - hopefully they didn't crash the computer.

I knew also what some of the functions were doing, because I really enjoyed Mathematics in school, and
so was able to understand or program a function that would calculate the velocity of an object speeding up, or work out
the next position of a bouncing ball based on the tangent of where it collided with the edge of a screen or another
bouncing ball. Perhaps I also learned something from my Physics class in high school, although I really preferred Maths
at the time and did not really enjoy Physics.

Sometimes it was also learning by making mistakes, by experimenting and realizing certain things were completely broken,
but then the feeling of getting it right was quite satisfying, especially seeing your work come to life while watching
the screensaver or showing off the game to a friend before playing it together.

I also knew about the various things that would be covered in the A+ exams that one of my schoolmates was also doing in
his spare time, because I'd helped my Dad build PC's while at home, whether it was our own PC's or for his business.

I knew what the various connectors on the motherboard were for, what the wires meant, the difference between a PS/2 port
and how you should turn off a printer before connecting a parallel port. These days people complain about USB never
going in the right way on the first try; I don't think they've ever had to unscrew connections from the back of a
computer using a screwdriver, hoping that also when they plug ports back in that no pins got bent!

I knew Windows quite well, since I had used DOS, MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows 98SE, Windows ME, Windows NT 4.1 and I think even WinNT3. But also I had tried out SCO Unix, SuSE Linux,
RedHat Linux, and many other types of Linux distributions, all before I had even left high school.

But it was university, which my parents sent me to, where all of my knowledge became truly solidified.
I had tried to teach myself C++ while on holiday with my parents in high school, where they bought me a book at a second
hand shop to learn Linux programming. There were examples in C++ using the Qt framework, but it was too much for me.
Later on I got a proper Practical C++ book, brand new from a store, and I spent ages reading it and trying out examples.
I struggled with it on Windows, struggled with it in Linux less so, but still it took a lot of time to understand.
And I still don't think I understood pointers then.

But in university, we learned more algorithms, theory of computation, Operating System details, C, C++, and finally the
lecturers explained concepts in a way that made it clearer to me how it worked. We learned Java, networking, theory on
compilers, artificial intelligence and ethics, and by the time I was completing my honours degree I had helped
build together with my classmates/friends a networked, multi-threaded IRC kind of server with a Java Swing based
chat client. Using the Java API's too, sending raw data using our own string based custom protocol.

I thought, I am now a programming star. But then I entered the working world, and realized just how little I knew.
Java EE, EJB3, Struts, Servlets, SOAP/XML, WebServices, C#, .NET, WPF. I knew HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, but there
were entire applications using it with AJAX, and this was even before the days of jQuery. I didn't really
understand what a closure meant in JavaScript, but I did understand that it looked like a lambda we saw in my
Computer Science degree and Maths courses, so I assumed it was just a function but completely missed the whole
idea of how it affects the scope of a program, until I went on a deep dive one year trying to understand how
jQuery worked by following a presentation I found online from John Resig.

Finally, I figured I was now a JavaScript expert. But then along came KnockoutJS, DurandalJS, AngularJS, React, Angular,
ES5 to ES6, and the myriad of tools we see every week. To this day, I have been developing software for a very long
time, but there are things I am learning every day. I think this is what I enjoy about the software development process:
it's a creative process.

Things are always changing, there are always new creations. These days, generative AI will likely transform our
industry, and well, the entire world's way of working across multiple industries. It feels like OpenAI and ChatGPT are
revolutionary, and that the "new industrial revolution" is upon us. With all this in mind, I realize I may be rambling a
bit and straying off the course, but actually, no, this course is all about learning how to program from scratch.

Because, the software world can at times be overwhelming, so it will always help, to sharpen the saw
(as Stephen Covey says) going over the concepts to re-learn and share this knowledge. That is what I intend to do.

I owe a lot of my life to the efforts of my father and all he provided for me. He passed away from cancer in recent
years, and I feel like he would want me to share something to the world, in order to benefit others. This is something
he himself was always willing to do. He was a kind and honorable man and I hope to honor his legacy, by sharing my
knowledge, and teaching you out in the open.

Whether you need me to or can just ask some AI the same things, I don't know. But what I do know, is that the best time
to start is now.

So, let's start!
