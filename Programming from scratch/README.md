# Programming from scratch

At the beginning of the year, I posted this on [LinkedIn][1]

I received a reply from an old colleague:

Well, half a year has gone by so far and I still don't have any content online for this, so it seems just as the
universe may be neverending, perhaps my procrastination on this topic is too üòÅ

It is not that I have not attempted to start on this. In fact, my girlfriend is surprised by the number of times I have
factory reset my laptop this year.

My goal for this course was to really start out from the beginning, where you would have a Windows computer with nothing
installed on it, and then walk through how I would setup everything, before heading into the actual programming part.
I would try and explain concepts, and walk through topics such as what computation is, what is a computer, how does your
computer actually work with the Central Processing Unit (CPU), and then lead into Operating Systems, applications, and
how to then create your own apps.

Each time I would first download Open Broadcaster Studio (OBS) at least, but in order to do that I would have to open up
the default browser (Edge) so that I could download and install it. This means I would not record the initial setup I
would go through, which may be important for someone that has never really used their computer much.

Now, perhaps someone who has not even used Edge before would not really be the target audience.

But, who knows what my target audience may be?!

This is something I struggle with myself in my day-job as a Senior Software Engineer and Technical Lead: often what may
be second nature and basic to some, is not always simple and easy to follow for others.

So, I reset my computer and tried again, this time using the command line `winget` tool to install OBS. I then decided
to record myself installing all the various applications we may use in the course, but realized that sometimes its
best to do this in a specific order, because it can make things easier. So, then I started yet again.

I won't go through all the attempts at re-starting, nevermind the times I had to rediscover which OBS settings to use.

What I will mention though, is that eventually it came down to me not really having a script to follow. As much as I
want to just wing it, like all the streamers and content creators on Twitch, YouTube and even TikTok these days do...
I myself get a bit distracted at times and so having a set script or at least syllabus from which to base the course on
is something necessary.

At least one thing was finalized, that I decided on an initial project to work towards: building a Snake game, like some
may have played on their mobile phones in the days of the Nokia 3310. I remember playing the game even earlier though
on Windows in the form of [Rattler Race][2].

So finally, this is why I created this repo. To try and become a bit more structured with it. Or at least, if I'm not,
to start creating some content in the form of markdown documents that can at the very least be a creative outlet for me,
and hopefully they can form a basis of an actual "Programming from scratch", and other courses.

Welcome, and thank you for reading üôÇ
