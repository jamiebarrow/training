    <h1>Snake</h1>
    
    <p>This project is about creating a snake game clone.</p>

    <p>The rules of the game are below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The player controls a snake which starts off at a random position on the map</li>
        <li>The map is divided into squares, and the snake initially is 3 squares in length</li>
        <li>At each tick of the game, the snake moves one square forward in the direction it is moving</li>
        <li>You can change the direction of the snake using the direction keys</li>
        <li>Apples appear on the map, and if the snake eats an apple it will grow in length by one square</li>
        <li>If a snake moves into a wall, or the edge of the map, the snake dies</li>
    </ul>
