# training

This repo is a space where I plan to create my own training content.

## Courses - WIP

Below is a list of courses I am working on, and which will likely evolve over time as I make time to contribute towards
them. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to let me know them!

- [Programming from scratch](./Programming%20from%20scratch/README.md)
    - A course that will go from the basics, and teach how to program, even from first principles of understanding what
      a computer is, how it works, and really trying to understand the science behind the magic being created everyday
      in the software development world

- [JavaScript](./Courses/JavaScript/README.md)
    - A course for developers to learn JavaScript, both for beginners and for experienced people.

- [Rust](./Courses/Rust/README.md)
    - I want to learn Rust myself, it has been a goal for a while, and I did start a while ago, but forgot a lot if not
      all of it because I don't use it everyday. They say the best way to learn is to teach, so lets see if I can do
      at least one of these :P
